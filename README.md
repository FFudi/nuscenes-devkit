this is myself contained nuScenes devkit which add a lot data exploration scripts here, besides, currently I added some packages enable people easy train there networks:

- nuScenes2kitti: this package can convert nuScenes to kitti format, which you can using for training object detection or CenterNet as mono camera 3d detection;
- nuScenes2bag: converts nuScenes data to rosbag, then you can do realtime lidar detection with ROS.



## Install

You just need to download nuScenes data, then you can start to explorate the data.
